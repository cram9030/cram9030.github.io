## Project Details

The Anti-Phase Asymmetric Quiet Rotor Technology project explored innovative approaches to reducing noise in urban air mobility vehicles. The project investigated multiple rotor designs that used asymmetric blade patterns and specialized trailing edge modifications to disrupt the harmonic reinforcement of blade vortices, a major source of rotor noise. The research was particularly focused on addressing community acceptance challenges for urban air mobility operations where noise levels need to be comparable to road vehicles (around 65 dBA at 250 ft).

Through wind tunnel testing at NASA Ames Research Center's Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, the project demonstrated that anti-phase rotor designs could reduce blade vortex interaction noise while maintaining or improving thrust performance. Four different designs were tested: a sine wave trailing edge, an adjusted sine wave, a corrugated pattern, and an asymmetric winglet configuration. The designs showed up to 1 dBA reduction in noise while increasing thrust by 5-10% compared to conventional rotors. This seemingly small noise reduction could translate to meaningful operational benefits - potentially allowing vehicles to operate about 27 feet closer to observers while maintaining the same perceived noise levels.

I led the experimental investigation and analysis effort, designing the test campaign to evaluate both acoustic and aerodynamic performance. I developed the control systems for the experiments, implementing real-time thrust control and RPM management. I performed detailed analysis of the acoustic data, characterizing the noise reduction mechanisms and identifying optimal operating conditions for each design. 

The research was interesting; I was surprised at how little additional vibration and wear the asymmetry caused. The asymmetry is a pretty small change in comparison to things like the number and length of the blades. I could see this technology being used to alleviate a particularly annoying frequency of cause-by-blade vortex interaction, but there are probably better tools in the designer's toolbox than starting here.
