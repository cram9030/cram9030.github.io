## Project Details

Bird strikes pose a significant challenge for aviation, with the first recorded incident occurring just two years after the Wright brothers' initial flight. As the aviation industry moves towards Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles operating at lower altitudes in urban environments, it is critical to understand and mitigate bird strike risks. This project analyzed 30 years of FAA wildlife strike data to assess the unique risks and challenges that AAM vehicles might face.

The analysis revealed that nearly 82% of bird strikes occur below 4,000 feet - precisely where AAM vehicles are expected to operate. The study established a new baseline for bird strike risk assessment specific to AAM operations by examining Part 135 operator data and correlating it with operational hours. This work identified several key risk factors unique to AAM operations, including the impact of quieter electric propulsion systems on bird awareness and the operational implications of strikes at space-constrained vertiports.

I had entered into the work on this project with the expectation that it would indicate that bird strikes were a significant enough issue that conducting research into mitigating them with onboard technology (in particular detect and avoid technology) was necessary; after going through the analysis though the indication is that the current mitigations align with the level of design safety. The current Wildlife Hazard Mitigation Programs' efficacy was rather impressive. It provided a strong case to be adopted by AAM operations along with existing technology like the Pulselite system instead of something more exotic. Like most applications relating to operation autonomous of an onboard pilot the baseline safety case is hard to gather because the contributions of the human pilot avoiding hazardous situations is a hidden contribution.

As the sole contributor to this analysis, I developed novel data processing techniques to filter and analyze the FAA Wildlife Strike Database, correlating strike data with operational parameters to create meaningful risk metrics for AAM vehicles. I identified critical trends in bird strike patterns and proposed potential mitigation strategies based on historical data. This work directly influenced aircraft design considerations and operational planning for AAM vehicles.
