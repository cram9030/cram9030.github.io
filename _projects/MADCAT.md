## Project Details

The MADCAT project was an innovative NASA initiative exploring the use of lightweight, digital composite structures for adaptive aerospace applications. The project focused on developing a morphing wing that could actively change shape during flight using internal actuation and digital cellular composite materials. This novel approach replaced traditional rigid control surfaces with a flexible, programmable structure that could continuously adapt its geometry to optimize aerodynamic performance.

The project successfully demonstrated several groundbreaking achievements in aerospace technology. Using a cellular lattice-based design, the team created an ultralight wing structure with a density comparable to aerogel (5.6 mg/cmÂ³) but with the stiffness of an elastomer (2.6 MPa). The structure's innovative digital assembly method also enabled rapid manufacturing, repair, and reconfiguration - addressing key challenges in adaptive aerostructure development.
