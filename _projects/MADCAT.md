## Project Details

The MADCAT project was an innovative NASA initiative exploring the use of lightweight, digital composite structures for adaptive aerospace applications. The project focused on developing a morphing wing that could actively change shape during flight using internal actuation and digital cellular composite materials. This novel approach replaced traditional rigid control surfaces with a flexible, programmable structure that could continuously adapt its geometry to optimize aerodynamic performance.

The project successfully demonstrated several groundbreaking achievements in aerospace technology. Using a cellular lattice-based design, the team created an ultralight wing structure with a density comparable to aerogel (5.6 mg/cm³) but with the stiffness of an elastomer (2.6 MPa). The structure's innovative digital assembly method also enabled rapid manufacturing, repair, and reconfiguration - addressing key challenges in adaptive aerostructure development.

As a Research Engineer on the project, I led the design of MADCAT v1 in the top picture and the development of the aeroservoelastic modeling and control systems for both vehicles. My contributions included creating and validating models for the wing's structural dynamics and aerodynamic behavior in MATLAB and JAVA. I also served as the system engineer and test lead for the ultra-lightweight wind tunnel model, which achieved a density one-third that of comparable models while maintaining required performance characteristics.
