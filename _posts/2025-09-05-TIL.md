I had been working on a [side project](https://github.com/cram9030/continuum-robot) that included taking a lot of long derivatives, so I started using [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) and some notebooks to take the derivatives. I wanted to move them over to the [wiki Modeling page](https://github.com/cram9030/continuum-robot/wiki/Modeling). I could have just used the [SymPy latex printing function](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/printing.html), but I decided to try and just feed the notebook straight to Claude with my code context. 

The output can be seen [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/7e73e106-b637-4432-9544-e3a75b6b981e). There were a few things I liked about the output from Claude over the LaTeX printing. The first is that it provided meaningful headers, and the second is that it provided the variable definitions for the equations. Those are pretty minor advantages, especially considering the amount of time I had to spend checking the conversion output that I would not have had to if I were using the print function.

So I don't think it saved me any time, but I did learn it was possible. I could see it being useful for polishing a more stream-of-consciousness notebook into something that could be shared with others.
