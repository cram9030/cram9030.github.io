I recently had the occasion to start playing with a robot arm in IsaacSim. At the same time, I've been playing around with Anthropic Claude, trying to understand both what it is good at and how it might fit into my workflow to make me more productive. Most of my experimenting has fallen into two categories, questions instead of Google searches or asking it to create specific classes or functions for something I am working on. I've had various levels of success, but this post is about something a little different. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <img src="/assets/images/fanuc_arm.jpg" alt="Robot Arm on table with cofee cup" title="Fanuc Robot Arm" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>

Starting with the problem I had set up was pretty standard and easy. The Fanuc robotic arm in the picture was supposed to move and "pick up" the coffee cup. The pickup wasn't going to include a gripper; instead, it was really getting the end effector vaguely close to the mug. Given the robot's geometry, I decided it wasn't even necessary to do the inverse kinematics. I could just use the direct geometry of the arms to make a single triangle and get it into the correct location. The real issue was what I mentally thought "vaguely" was. Did I need the end effector to actually touch it? Could I get away with just keeping the final link at a fixed angle? Would it clearly look/feel wrong?
<br/><br/>
I was already working in a simulation environment, but it was hosted on the cloud, and I was having a little trouble with the lag when I was orienting the camera, enough that it felt tedious to get the view I wanted when I was really just going for a two-dimensional problem so instead I ask Claude to help me out. I provided it with a urdf I was using from the [crx_description](https://github.com/paolofrance/crx_description/tree/be8a3fb7d8e61a55d3399794b4e42fb8cfd288f1) repository and provided with the prompt:
<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > <em>Using the style and dimensions provided below as well as the notation from controllers.yaml and crx20ia_l.urdf.xarco please create a website that takes in the specified joint angles and displays the 2-D configuration and end effector location.<em>


<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <img src="/assets/images/Fanuc-v1.jpg" alt="A line on x and y axis" title="Not a robot" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>

Which was not really correct. The input section is not shown in the picture, but essentially, it was doing the full forward kinematics of the arm but only showing the second link because the visualization was 2-D and only showed a single plane. At this point, a very simple reminder of which joints I actually cared about was all that was necessary.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;> <em> The graph is not displaying correctly as only one of the linkages is displayed. Also, please keep in mind we are only plotting and using J2, J3, and J5 as part of the 2-D projection. Can you please provide an update?<em> 
<br/><br/>

Which worked like a charm and resulted in the little guy below where I would play around with to my hearts content and get the idea what felt right from an assumption stant point.
