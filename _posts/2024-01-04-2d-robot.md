# Distributed Space Systems

Recent work on developing autonomous coordination between multiple spacecraft in distributed space systems.

This project focused on developing software to enable spacecraft to work together autonomously, reducing the need for ground control intervention and enabling new types of space missions.

Key achievements:
- Developed distributed planning algorithms
- Demonstrated autonomous coordination
- Reduced response time from hours to minutes
