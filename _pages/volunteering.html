    <div class="intro-paragraph">
        <p>I believe in giving back to the community through technical mentorship and STEM education initiatives. I'm particularly passionate about helping underrepresented groups gain access to aerospace and robotics careers, supporting sustainable technology development, and sharing my expertise with the next generation of engineers and scientists. If you have volunteer opportunities in these areas, I'm always open to discussing how I might contribute. I am also more than happy to engage in one on one mentorship activiites.</p>
